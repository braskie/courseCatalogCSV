title: 'SPASD Course Catalog'

{{< callout type="warning" >}}
This site is an example SPASD course catalog and should **not be considered an authoritative source**.
{{< /callout >}}

The course entries are representative of the kinds of data found in the district but are not guaranteed accurate — I'm currently working on wiring an automated, accurate data pull directly from the Infinite Campus SIS so the listings will reflect official information in the future.

The site is built with the Hugo static site generator: course pages, department sections, menus, and search data are produced from structured data (CSV/YAML/remote sheets) and Hugo templates/shortcodes at build time, meaning pages are generated from the data rather than written by hand.
