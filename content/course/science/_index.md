## Mission Statement

Students will be lifelong scientific learners that view science as both a body of knowledge and an evidence-based model and theory building enterprise that continually extends, refines, and revises knowledge. Each course will be centered on scientific and engineering practices, crosscutting concepts, and disciplinary core ideas. Scientific opportunities will be linked with the community and explored through careers, which connect to the real world.
