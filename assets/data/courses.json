Teaching and learning will focus on... - Number and Quantity: The Real Number System, Quantities - Algebra: Seeing Structure in Expressions, Creating Equations, Reasoning with Equations and Inequalities - Functions: Interpreting Functions, Linear, Quadratic and Exponential Models - Statistics and Probability: Interpreting Categorical and Quantitative Data The Standards for Mathematical Practice will be addressed throughout the course as teachers plan and implement effective math instructional practices. These practices describe the behaviors and habits of mind we want all mathematically proficient students to exhibit. Math Practice 1: Make sense of problems and persevere in solving them. Math Practice 2: Reason abstractly and quantitatively. Math Practice 3: Construct viable arguments and appreciate and critique the reasoning of others. Math Practice 4: Model with mathematics. Math Practice 5: Use appropriate tools strategically. Math Practice 6: Attend to precision. Math Practice 7: Look for and make use of structure. Math Practice 8: Look for and express regularity in repeated reasoning. Math I will also integrate the following Social Emotional Learning (SEL) Standards: SEL 4: Learners will be able to independently use organizational skills and strategies to focus attention by working toward long-term personal and academic goals.

Biological Engineering and Environmental Sustainability is a high school-level specialization course in Project Lead The Way (PLTW) Engineering. In ES, students investigate and design solutions to solve real-world challenges related to clean drinking water, a stable food supply, and renewable energy. Students are introduced to environmental issues and use the engineering design process to research and design potential solutions. Utilizing the activity-, project-, and problem-based (APB) teaching and learning pedagogy, students transition from completing structured activities to solving open-ended projects and problems that require them to develop planning, documentation, communication, and other professional skills. Through both individual and collaborative team activities, projects, and problems, students problem solve as they practice common design and scientific protocols such as project management, lab techniques, and peer review. Students develop skills in designing experiments, conducting research, executing technical skills, documenting design solutions according to accepted technical standards, and creating presentations to communicate solutions.&nbsp;<\/p><p><br><\/p><p>The course of study includes:&nbsp;<\/p><p>• Introduction to Environmental Sustainability&nbsp;<\/p><p>• Ensuring Safe and Abundant Water&nbsp;<\/p><p>• World Food Security&nbsp;<\/p><p>• Renewable Fuels&nbsp;<\/p><p><br><\/p><p>*College credit is dependent on school certification and passing the end-of-course assessment.
