Students will learn the curriculum designated by the College Board in order for students to successfully pass the AP\nEnvironmental Science test, thus, possibly gaining college credit depending on the university or college attended by the student. Of equal importance, students will learn the multidisciplinary approaches used to assess, monitor, and abate problems within the environment we live. After\ncompleting the course, students will be able to assess their role within the environment and make personal decisions that will lead to an environmentally sustainable future for their community, state, country, and all human beings. Because we are studying the environment, great emphasis will be placed on conducting real science within the Sun Prairie community. Obviously, this requires us to be outdoors a good deal of time in all weather conditions, sampling and collecting data within our immediate environment. A natural result of this type of science requires more advanced analysis and write-ups than do simple “fill in the answer” labs.&nbsp; Due to the complexity of society, it would be inappropriate to study environmental science in the vacuum of pure science. Instead, we will seek to incorporate social sciences such as economics, politics, ethics, and law to understand real-world perspectives on environmental problems.\nhttp:\/\/www.collegeboard.com\/student\/testing\/ap\/sub_envsci.html?envsciSERVICE LEARNING OPPORTUNITY\n\n&nbsp;",
